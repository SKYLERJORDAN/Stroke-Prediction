## Overview
Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death globally. Early prediction of stroke risk can help in timely intervention and potentially save lives. This project uses machine learning techniques to classify patients based on stroke risk by leveraging various health indicators and demographic information.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- **Demographics:** Age, gender, marital status, and residence type.
- **Health Metrics:** Hypertension, heart disease, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status.
- **Target Variable:** Stroke occurrence (binary).

Please refer to the notebook for more details on data preprocessing and feature engineering steps.

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/stroke-prediction.git
cd stroke-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: The notebook contains steps for handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and scaling numerical data.
2. **Model Training**: Multiple models such as logistic regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods are trained and evaluated.
3. **Prediction**: After training, you can use the model to predict stroke risk on new data.

Run the notebook cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and train the models.

## Models and Evaluation
This project explores various models:
- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting**

Each model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to determine the best model for predicting stroke risk.

## Results
The best-performing model achieves an F1 score of X (example) on the test set, suggesting it could be viable for further development and real-world testing.
