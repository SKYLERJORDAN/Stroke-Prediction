# Summarize
For this project, I analyzed stroke data to gain an understanding of what may be the cause. The reason I chose this dataset was because many people I knew had experienced strokes, and I wanted to see what some of the causes might be. During the process, I had to look through each feature and determine whether it had any correlation with a person having or increasing their risk of stroke. Additionally, I used a predictive model to predict whether a patient's lifestyle would lead to a stroke, and with a DecisionTreeClassifier model, I was able to achieve 98% accuracy.
